## What is this?

Quite a few people have asked me about the last stable incarnation of Smart Connections.

But in a rather peculiar turn of events (which I'll elaborate on in a moment) - the sort of thing that happens when human egos get entangled - I found myself, shall we say, excommunicated from the original repository.

In the event that this last working version might disappear, I've preserved it here, like a pressed flower in an old book, with some modest touching-up including GPT-4o integration and some little sliders for temperature and top_p.

So how did we get here?  

The original author, in what one might call a moment of premature enlightenment, released what he called Version 2 - but it wasn't quite ready to leave the nest, as it were. And when I, having helped debug quite a bit over the years, pointed out this rather obvious truth, well... let's just say it wasn't received with the same spirit in which it was given.

It's rather fascinating how people react when someone holds up a mirror to reality. It's like trying to convince someone that their imaginary boat won't actually float - they might not appreciate the observation, but the water doesn't care about our feelings about it, does it? Truth remains truth. And sometimes truth can be rather uncomfortable. 

Here we have this beautiful tool that worked splendidly, like well-tuned instrument, playing its melody perfectly well. But in the attempt to improve it, we've created something that doesn't quite work at all.

But isn't that just the way things go? The more we try to perfect something, the further we sometimes get from its essential nature.


What makes this situation particularly noteworthy is that while the community has freely given their time and expertise to help debug and improve this tool, these contributions are being channeled toward what will ultimately be a paid product. There's something rather poignant about using volunteers' goodwill and free labor to develop a commercial venture - especially when those intentions aren't particularly clear in the process. 

It's rather like inviting friends to help build what they think is a community garden, only to put up a fence and charge admission.

Perhaps my exile was inevitable - after all, pointing out that V2 is riddled with bugs might discourage potential buyers and donors. 

But shouldn't potential supporters have the right to know what they're investing in?

I bear no ill will toward Brian. It's all part of this magnificent cosmic dance we're all twisted up in. Though I do hope, in that mysterious way that understanding sometimes dawns upon us, that he comes to see what we all see - that his new creation isn't quite performing the function it's meant to perform. 

In the end, this precisely the kind of situation that leads to new growth.

And for what it's worth, @brianpetro, I'm sorry if my observations offended you. But I can promise that I am just one among many with the same sentiment. Just browse the web and see countless other repeating the same thing. I'm just the only one crazy enough to take the heat from telling you to your face.

Enjoy.
